## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep teal (#008080) to convey professionalism and sophistication.
- Background color: Very light grayish-teal (#F0F8FA). It's close in hue to the primary, very desaturated and bright, making it suitable for a light-themed site.
- Accent color: Pale cyan (#77D9D9). It is analogous to the teal, yet very different in saturation and brightness to provide adequate contrast for visual pop.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter' (sans-serif) for a clean, modern, and readable experience.  If code snippets are anticipated, 'Source Code Pro' should be used for displaying code snippets.
- Use a consistent set of simple, professional icons.
- Clean, responsive layout with a focus on readability and clear information hierarchy.
- Subtle animations to enhance user experience (e.g., smooth scrolling, hover effects).
